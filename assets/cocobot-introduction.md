## Hi, I'm `@cocobot`

Well, well, well; look who dared to mention me, {user}! Let me introduce myself real quick: **I'm a customized bot** at the ripe age of `{version}`, whose latest birthday was {date_ago}.

Unlike my [coconutâ€“cult](https://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-figures/august-engelhardt-coconut.htm) leader `@ai`, who enjoys annoying you with ridiculous
coconut-related jokes or trying to pick a fight, I'm proud to say that I deliver commands that are **actually helpful** and keep "advice" from our beloved cocovore [August 
Engelhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Engelhardt) at bay. Simply type `/cocobot` and choose one of my functions. No coconuts required, I promise!

**Oh, before I forget:** Feel free to make me even *more* useful by contributing via [my GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/thaikolja/discord-cocobot).

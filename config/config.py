"""
Configuration file for managing environment variables and application constants.

This module centralizes the retrieval of sensitive keys and configuration parameters
from the environment, making them readily available as constants throughout the application.
It leverages the `dotenv` library to load these values from a `.env` file,
promoting a clean separation of configuration from code.

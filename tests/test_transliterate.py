# Import required testing modules

# Import Discord and commands module for bot functionality

# Import the Transliterate cog to test
# Assuming the path is correct relative to your tests directory
from cogs.transliterate import Transliterate


# Import configuration for error messages
# Make sure this path is correct and ERROR_MESSAGE is defined
# We might need the exact value of ERROR_MESSAGE if it's used directly in some outputs
# Let's assume based on the output it might be:
# ERROR_MESSAGE = "ü•• Oops, something's cracked, and it's **not** the coconut! Blame @Kolja, the coconut head; he programmed me, after all!"
# Or maybe: ERROR_MESSAGE = "ü•• Oops, something's cracked, and it's **not** the coconut!"
# We'll use the strings directly from the 'Actual' output in the failed tests below.
